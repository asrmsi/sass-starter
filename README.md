SASS Starter
================================
I start most of my projects with this stuff:

- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Zen-Grids](http://zengrids.com/)
- [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/)
- [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/)

Caveat
================================

I barely know what I am doing. I intend for this to be a personal starting point for my own projects. If you want to use it, then by all means go for it, but I can't guarantee anything.
